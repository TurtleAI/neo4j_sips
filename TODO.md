### TODO

- finalize the Model support; refactor the legacy tests and add more comprehensive ones
- add support for Multiple Endpoints. Still trying to convince myself that this is really needed ;)
- implement the Ecto driver, using neo4j_sips as its foundation
- add support for connecting to a Neo4j instance using: [Bolt](https://dzone.com/articles/introducing-bolt-neo4js-upcoming-binary-protocol-p), Neo4j's upcoming binary protocol.
